# Applying our new Commandline Powers to PicoCTF

PicoCTF is an online CTF (Capture The Flag) aimed at introducing students to CTF competition. Participants learn to overcome sets of challenges from six domains of cybersecurity including general skills, cryptography, web exploitation, forensics, etc. The challenges are all set up with the intent of being hacked, making it an excellent, legal way to get hands-on experience.

For the next couple of labs, you are going to try solve as many of the Easy **General Skills** challenges as you can. You should solve these using the command line tricks and basic python that you've covered. 

## Getting Started
To get started you'll need to go create an account on picoctf.com

## Filtering Challenges
Once registered, You can go to the practice section and filter the challenges by 'Easy' and 'General Skills'

> There should be just under 40 challenges available for you to attempt. 

If you look at the number of solves to can figure out the easier challenges, which are the ones you should start with. These are mainly on pages 3 and 4 of the filtered challenges.

## Solving Challenges
Create a new private Repo and store all of your solutions as you progress through them.

Try solve as much of each challenge on the command line. So rather than just clicking links and downloading files, use wget from the CLI. Rather than use online tools again try use python and the commandline for as much as possible.
